::group::Healing 'pandas': Filter-Then-Scan Strategy

--- Phase 1: Filtering for compatible versions ---
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==3.0.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is `setuptools` failing to prepare editable metadata for `boruta_py_AURA` in a `python3.11` environment, which resulted in an `exit code: 1`.
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.3.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is a `subprocess-exited-with-error` during metadata preparation by `setuptools` (initiated by `pip` within a Python 3.11 environment), with the log not providing explicit details on the specific conflicting package versions beyond the Python runtime.
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.3.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict originates from an incompatibility within the `setuptools` package's `_distutils` component, causing a build failure during metadata preparation in the Python 3.11 environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.3.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is that `setuptools` failed to prepare editable metadata for the project, triggering an exit code 1 error during its `setup()` execution within a `python3.11` environment, though specific conflicting package versions beyond Python 3.11 are not explicitly detailed in the provided log.
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.3.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause is an undisclosed dependency conflict preventing `setuptools` from successfully preparing editable metadata for the package within a `python3.11` environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.2.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause is an incompatibility leading to a build error within setuptools (sourced from `/home/runner/work/boruta_py_AURA/boruta_py_AURA/temp_pip_check/lib/python3.11/site-packages/setuptools/`) during metadata preparation for an editable package in a Python 3.11 environment, specifically failing to initialize a distribution class.
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.2.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is rooted in `setuptools`'s inability to successfully prepare editable metadata for the project within the `python3.11` environment, likely due to an incompatibility between the project's build requirements and the version of `setuptools` being utilized.
  -> Checking compatibility of pandas==2.2.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause is a build-time incompatibility where `setuptools` failed to prepare editable metadata for the project in a Python `3.11` environment, likely due to its reliance on deprecated `distutils` components.

--- Phase 2: Validating compatible versions (newest first) ---
Result: No compatible versions were found. Reverting to last known good version.

::group::Healing 'numpy': Filter-Then-Scan Strategy

--- Phase 1: Filtering for compatible versions ---
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.4.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict stems from a failure in `setuptools` to successfully prepare editable metadata for `boruta_py_AURA` (commit `4d755e7ed3d2be551c9cf74e2737dd80e14f628c`), suggesting an incompatibility during the build process executed by `pip` within the Python 3.11 environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.4.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is `setuptools` failing to prepare editable metadata for the project within the `python3.11` environment, indicating an incompatibility with the project's build configuration or unstated dependencies.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.4.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause is a dependency conflict where `setuptools` failed to prepare editable metadata for the `boruta_py_AURA` project in a Python 3.11 environment, indicating an incompatibility between the project's build requirements and the specific Python version or the implicitly used `setuptools` version.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.5...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause is a dependency conflict where `setuptools` failed to prepare editable metadata for the project in the Python 3.11 environment, likely due to an incompatibility with the project's build configuration.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.4...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is an unspecified incompatibility within the `setuptools` build process during editable metadata preparation in a `python3.11` environment, as specific versions for `pip` or `setuptools` involved in the conflict are not explicitly detailed in the provided log.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is rooted in an unhandled error within the `setuptools` build backend, specifically its `build_meta.py` module found at `/home/runner/work/boruta_py_AURA/boruta_py_AURA/temp_pip_check/lib/python3.11/site-packages/setuptools/`, which prevents the successful preparation of editable metadata for the project under Python 3.11.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause is a `subprocess-exited-with-error` originating from `setuptools` during the preparation of editable metadata within a `python3.11` environment, though the provided log does not explicitly specify a dependency conflict or the exact package versions involved.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is caused by `setuptools` and `pip` components failing to prepare editable metadata for a package within a `Python 3.11` environment, indicating an incompatibility that prevents the build process from completing.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.3.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict stems from `setuptools` failing to successfully prepare editable metadata for the project under Python 3.11, indicated by an exit code 1 when attempting to execute the project's `setup()` function.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.6...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The dependency conflict is a build-time failure within `setuptools` (running on `python3.11`) that prevents preparing editable metadata, specifically caused by an internal error when calling `distutils.core.setup`.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.5...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is an unspecified internal error within `setuptools` during the preparation of editable metadata for a package, encountered in a `python3.11` environment, but the specific conflicting package versions are not explicitly detailed in this log.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.4...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause of the dependency conflict is a build failure during `setuptools`'s preparation of editable metadata (triggered by `pip`) in a `python3.11` environment, due to an unspecified error when executing the project's setup script.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.3...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The provided log indicates a build failure within `setuptools` during the preparation of editable package metadata, rather than an explicit dependency conflict, with the issue occurring in a Python 3.11 environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.2...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause is an internal build error within `setuptools`, preventing `pip` from successfully preparing editable metadata from `pyproject.toml` on Python 3.11, due to an unspecified issue during the build process.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.1...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause is a dependency conflict where the `setuptools` package (located at `site-packages/setuptools/`) failed with `exit code: 1` during the preparation of editable metadata for `pyproject.toml`, a process orchestrated by the `pip` package (located at `site-packages/pip/`), indicating an incompatibility between the project's build configuration and these specific installed build tool versions.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.2.0...
     -- Incompatible. Diagnosis: The root cause is an incompatibility leading to a build failure during editable metadata preparation, indicating an issue with the `setuptools` build backend when executed in the `python3.11` environment.
  -> Checking compatibility of numpy==2.1.3...
